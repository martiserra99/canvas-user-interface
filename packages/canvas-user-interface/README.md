# canvas-user-interface

The JavaScript library to build canvas user interfaces.

## Overview

Canvas User Interface is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces using the canvas element. It manages all the complexities of using the canvas to let you develop anything you want as easy as possible.

The way it works is by providing you a way to build elements (ex: image), place them as you want (ex: aligned in the middle) and interact with them to make them do something (ex: move when key pressed).

## Installation

To install this package you have to run the following command.

```shell
npm install canvas-user-interface
```
